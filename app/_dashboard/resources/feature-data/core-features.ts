// QUESTIONS FOR USER:
// 1. Should the 'Lead Management' section include advanced lead routing/assignment features?
// 2. For 'Email Management', do you want to highlight integration with external email providers (Gmail, Outlook)?
// 3. Should 'Contact Management' include import/export and bulk update features?
// 4. Are there any compliance/privacy requirements to emphasize in any of these features?
// 5. Should we include more real-world case studies or user testimonials for each feature?
